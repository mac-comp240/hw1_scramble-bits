## What should work in the terminal

Commands that should work to run this problem:


    make clean
    make 

    ./scramble_bits
	
Design your Makefile accordingly. The graders should be able to type exactly these commands in the terminal and get good output.

## Description

Suppose you wish to use an encryption mechanism in which every four bytes of a data stream will be scrambled.  Suppose we label the bits like this:

<pre>
    --------------------------------------
    |xxxx|nnnnnnnnnnn|eee|vvvvvvvvv|xxxxx|
    --------------------------------------
    31-28   27-17    16-14   13-5    4-0
</pre>

The bits will be manipulated according to the following rules.


* The bits in the positions labeled x are not moved.
* The bit field labeled n swaps positions with the bit field labeled v: the rightmost bit of n moves to position 5 and the leftmost bit of v shifts to position 27.
* The field labeled e moves two positions to the left to make room for the swap of the n and v bits.

Here is an outline of how to get this done:

1. Define four AND masks to isolate the bit fields x, n, e, and v
2. Write four AND instructions to decompose the 32-bit word, isolating the four sets of bits and storing them in variables named X, N, E, and V.
3. Write three shift instructions required to reposition the bits of N, E, and V.
4. Write an OR instruction to put the parts together in the shuffled orientation.

## Your Task
Write a C function *scramble* in the file `scramble.c` that will take an unsigned 32-bit integer as a parameter and return an unsigned 32-bit integer with the rules described above applied. 

Testing your function requires careful choice of test cases. Finish the basically empty file called `test.c` that contains your main program. Use comments in the *main* program that describe your test cases and why you chose them. Create your test bit patterns as hexadecimal values that get sent to your *scramble* function.

You will create the Makefile yourself. Use the ones from activities as your guide. **You must provide a makefile so that we can compile and run your code as follows and as previously stated above:**

    make clean
    make 

    ./scramble_bits

Use the functions from the class activities to print the bit pattern of the values input to and returned from the scramble function to verify its correctness. (Copy your `binary` function from data activity 1 or even better, copy the whole file hex.c into this workspace and add it to your Makefile)

Once you are fairly certain that you have it correct, then use `assert` calls to verify that the returned value is what you expect for the test cases that you devise. **You must have a range of tests that are thorough enough to insure the correctness of your function.** Learning how to do this is important and is an important part of your grade for this problem.
